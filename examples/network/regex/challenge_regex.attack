Feature: check to make sure the right ports are open on our server
 
  Background:
    Given "nmap" is installed
    And the following profile:
      | name       | value        |
      | host       | localhost    |

  Scenario: Verify server is open on expected ports
    When I launch an "nmap" attack with:
      """
      nmap -F <host>
      """
#   Then ...
# TODO: figure out a way to parse the output using one of the regex steps
# For hints consult the README.md
