# Challenge
This is not really a networking problem, but we thought this would be a good place to look at regex and output parsing with gauntlt. One popular network scanning tool, nmap, pads its output with spaces so it can make it difficult to parse the output reliably. Start with `challenge_regex.attack` and customize it so that you parse the output using regex. 

# Hints
You will need to use steps that have the word 'match' in them. To see possible steps you can use, run:
```
$ bundle exec gauntlt --allsteps
```

# Solution
Check `final_regex.attack` for a working solution answer.
