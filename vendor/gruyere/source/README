DO NOT COPY THIS CODE OR USE THIS OUTSIDE OF THE GAUNTLT WORKSHOP

WARNING! For educational and instructional purposes this code is included 
with the gauntlt-demo as a target machine for gauntlt testing. Because we 
are running Gruyere in a sandboxed environment, a few config settings were
changed to make it function.  Please see gruyere.py comments for information.

Gruyere with original configs can be found at http://google-gruyere.appspot.com/
