## Assert your network
To get started with this, go to `examples/assert_ports` and open up `challenge_assert-ports.attack`.  

### Try the challenge
Edit the `challenge_assert-ports.attack` and try to test to see if ONLY certain ports are open.  You can run `$ bundle exec gauntlt challenge_assert-ports.attack` to see if your solution works. Check the README.md in `examples/assert_ports` for hints.

### Hints
Check out the gauntlt wiki for a hint: [Assert your network services from the outside in using gauntlt](https://github.com/gauntlt/gauntlt/wiki/Assert-your-network-services-from-the-outside-in-using-gauntlt)

### Solution 
The answer is in `final_assert-ports.attack` and you can compare it to your solution. See the commented out section at the bottom for hints and a working solution.  Uncomment it and test it out.
