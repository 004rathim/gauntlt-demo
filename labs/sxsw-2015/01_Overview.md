## Rugged Software Using Rugged Driven Development - SXSW 2015

### Setup
You have two options for completing the labs:
* Use the pre-configured vagrant box as outlined in `02_Setup using Vagrant.md` (RECOMMENDED)
* Run gauntlt natively as described in `03_Setup using Bundler.md` (NOT RECOMMENDED)

Using the vagrant box is the only option we will be able to support in the workshop. The box comes with a few security tools already installed. 
This has been tested to work on Linux and OS X.
