## Start up our Target
We the `gauntlt-demo` includes two targets: railsgoat and gruyere.  For this workshop we are using gruyere which is a vulnerable web app built in python.

### Start Gruyere
```
$ cd ./vendor/gruyere
$ ./manual_launch.sh
```
You should be able to point your browser at http://localhost:8008 and see gruyere running.

Spend some time becoming familiar with gruyere and see what you can find. If you want some tips, check out http://google-gruyere.appspot.com/.
