## Be Mean to Your Code with Gauntlt and the Rugged Way - Velocity EU 2013 Workshop

### Setup
There are two options for working through the workshop.  The recommended way is to use the virtual box image as there are a couple of security tools (arachni, nmap, ...) that we will be using.  It is not required for you to use it though and you can just clone the repo if you have ruby 1.9.3 and bundler.

If you want to use the vagrant box setup for the workshop, please follow the instructions in `02_Using Vagrant Box.md` and if you want to just use our own box, follow the directions in `03_Using Repo Only.md`

This has been tested to work on linux and OS X.
